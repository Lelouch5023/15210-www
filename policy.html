  <h2>Grading Policy</h2>
  <ul id="grading">
    <li>45% Assignments</li>
    <li>30% Midterms</li>
    <li>25% Final</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Late Assignments</h2>
  <p>
  Homeworks are due at 11:59PM US Eastern Time unless otherwise noted on the assignment.
  </p>
  <p>
  You are permitted a budget of <strong>SIX late days per semester</strong>
  at no grade penalty. At most <strong>TWO late days may be used per
  assignment</strong>. If you have used up these six late days, your score
  will be reduced by 25% off of the total (not your score) per late day.
  Except in extraordinary circumstances, no late homework will be accepted
  beyond the late date.
  </p>
  <h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
  <p>
  All students are expected to be familiar with, and to comply with, the
  <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/Cheating.html">
    University Policy on Cheating and Plagiarism</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
  Any work submitted as a homework assignment or examination must be entirely
  your own and may not be derived from the work of others, whether a published
  or unpublished source, the worldwide web, another student, other textbooks,
  materials from another course (including prior semesters of this course),
  or any other person or program. You may not copy, examine, or alter anyone
  else's homework assignment or computer program, or use a computer program
    to transcribe or otherwise modify or copy anyone else's files.
  </p>
  <p>
  To facilitate cooperative learning, it is permissible to discuss a homework
  assignment with other students, provided that the following
  <em>whiteboard policy</em> is respected. A discussion may take place at the
  whiteboard (or using scrap paper, etc.), but no one is allowed to take
  notes or record the discussion of what is written on the board, and you
  must allow four hours to lapse after any discussion before working on the
  assignment. The fact that you can recreate the solution from memory is
  taken as proof that you actually understood it.
  </p>
  <p>
  We may sometimes run automatic code comparison programs (such as MOSS).
  These programs are very good at detecting similarity between code, even
  code that has been purposefully obfuscated. Such programs can compare a
  submitted assignment against all other submitted assignments, against
  all known previous solutions of a problem, etc. The signal-to-noise
  ratio of such comparisons is usually very distinctive, making it very
  clear what code is a student's original creative work and what code is
  merely transcribed from some other source.
